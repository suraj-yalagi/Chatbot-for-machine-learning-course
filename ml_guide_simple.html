    <h1>Machine Learning Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to 'learn' from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data to make predictions or decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Machine Learning Paradigms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Common Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Image and speech recognition</li>
        <li>Natural language processing</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
        <li>Financial forecasting</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of artificial neurons that can learn from and make decisions based on data.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Neurons:</strong> Basic computational units that process inputs and activate based on thresholds.</li>
        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Networks typically have an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Weights:</strong> Parameters adjusted during training to improve predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Functions that determine if a neuron should be activated (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Types of Neural Networks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Specially designed for processing grid-like data such as images.</li>
        <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Process sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):</strong> Special RNNs that can learn long-term dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> Consist of two networks that compete: a generator and a discriminator.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
    
    <h3>Supervised Learning Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Predicts a continuous output based on input features using a linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Used for binary classification, estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a class.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Models decisions as a tree of choices that lead to outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Forests:</strong> Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Partitions data into k clusters where each point belongs to the closest centroid.</li>
        <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong> Reduces dimensionality by finding principal components that capture maximum variance.</li>
        <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifies rare items, events or observations that differ significantly from the majority.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning</h2>
    
    <h3>Classification Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision:</strong> The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Recall (Sensitivity):</strong> The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.</li>
        <li><strong>F1 Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between both.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Regression Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> The average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.</li>
        <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> The average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.</li>
        <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> The square root of MSE, providing an error in the same units as the target variable.</li>
    </ul>
